The number of trick-or-treaters knocking on my door in any five minute interval between 6 and 8pm on Halloween night is distributed as a Poisson with a mean of 5 (ignoring time effects). The number of pieces of candy taken by each child, in addition to the expected one piece per child, is distributed as a Poisson with a mean of 1. What is the minimum number of pieces of candy that I should have on hand so that I have only a 5% probability of running out?
